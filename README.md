# HTML & JS questioner app project

This repository contains a sample for a simple questioner app, using vanilla html and Js. The game was created for the purposes of familiarisation with core web languages (html ,js, css).

The entry point for the app is `index.html` ,and the logic is separated into three js files :

 1. **game.js**: containing the logic for starting and playing the game
 2. **end.js**: containing the end game functionality
 3. **highscores.js** : containing the logic to display the best players score

The game is structured using four views (html) , and their corresponding styles (css).
